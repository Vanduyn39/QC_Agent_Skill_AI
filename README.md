# 🚀 QC Super Agent - Antigravity Automation

**QC Super Agent** is an AI assistant system running on the Antigravity platform, designed to automate the entire workflow of a Quality Control (QC) specialist: from reading business requirements to generating Test Cases, rapidly logging bugs, and automatically compiling daily/weekly reports with visual charts.

## 📌 Key Features
- **Automated Test Case Generation:** Automatically reads Requirement files (`.docx`, `.pdf`, `.xlsx`) **placed in the `inputs` folder**, generates standard format Test Cases, and pushes them directly to Google Sheets.
- **Lightning-fast Bug Logging:** Extracts bug information from natural language prompts, categorizes Severity/Priority according to project guidelines, and logs them into both local Excel files and Google Sheets.
- **Professional Reporting:**
    - **Daily Report:** Summarizes the number of bugs logged in a day and analyzes error modules.
    - **Weekly Report:** Provides statistics on bug trends over the week, accompanied by visual charts (`.png`).
- **Multi-Project Management:** Automatically categorizes and manages data based on the `assets/{project_name}` directory structure.

## 🛠 Google Sheets API Setup Guide

To allow the Agent to write data to the Cloud, you need to provide it with a "key" via the Google Cloud Console.

### 1. Create a Project and Get the Credentials File
1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a new Project (e.g., `QC-Automation-Agent`).
3. Navigate to **APIs & Services > Library**: Find and **Enable** the following two APIs:
    - **Google Sheets API**
    - **Google Drive API**
4. Navigate to **Credentials > Create Credentials > Service Account**:
    - Name the Service Account and click **Create**.
    - Once created, click on the email of that account, go to the **Keys** tab **> Add Key > Create New Key**.
    - Select **JSON** format. The file will be downloaded to your computer.
5. Rename the downloaded file to `credentials.json` and place it in the root directory of this repository.

### 2. Create the Sheet and Share Access (Crucial Step)
To avoid Google's storage limits (Quota Exceeded errors) for the Service Account, please follow this method:
1. Open the `credentials.json` file, find and copy the line containing `"client_email": "..."`.
2. Go to your personal Google Drive and create a new Google Sheet file. Name it exactly after your project (e.g., `Comana`).
3. Click the **Share** button in the top right corner.
4. Paste the Service Account email (from step 1), set the role to **Editor**, and click **Send**.
5. Repeat this process for any other projects you add.

## 🌱 How to Add a New Project
This system is highly scalable. If you want to use it for a new project, you **do not need to change any code**. Just follow these 3 simple steps:
1. **Duplicate Folders:** Duplicate an existing project folder in both `assets/` and `references/`.
2. **Rename:** Rename those duplicated folders to your new project's name (e.g., `assets/Project_X` and `references/Project_X`). Replace the old guidelines with the new project's rules.
3. **Create a new Google Sheet:** Create a new file on your Google Drive named `Project_X` and share Editor access with the Service Account email (just like step 2 in the Setup Guide).
